# Work Day Scheduler

This web application allows users with busy schedules to add important events to a daily planner so they can manage their time more effectively.

## How to use

This webpage can be view [here](https://kal-a11y.github.io/Work-day-scheduler/) or the link in the 'About' section of [this repository](https://github.com/Kal-a11y/Work-day-scheduler).

Users can add an event in the text area of the time block. Click the save button in the same time block to ensure that your event is saved. Times that have already passed are shown in gray, ones currently happening are shown in red, and ones that have not yet happened in green.
